<i>Dialog Music Player</i> is a most minimalistic music player requiring no permissions except to access your storage (so it can play your music).

Do not be irritated if you don't find a launcher icon: there currently is none. The app accepts music files to play via the "open with" feature of Android, e.g. via a file manager. And as it has no icon in the launcher: should you ever want to uninstall it, you'll have to do that via Android's <i>Settings › Apps</i> menu (or via the „market app“ you used to install it).
